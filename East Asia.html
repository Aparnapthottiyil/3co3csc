<h1>East Asia</h1>
<img src="Eastasia.jpg"width="300 pixel">
<p>East Asia is the eastern region of Asia, which is defined in both geographical and ethno-cultural terms.[8][9] The modern states of East Asia include China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan.[3][4][5][6] China, North Korea, South Korea and Taiwan are all unrecognised by at least one other East Asian state due to severe ongoing political tensions in the region, specifically the division of Korea and the political status of Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau, two small coastal quasi-dependent territories located in the south of China, are officially highly autonomous but are under de jure Chinese sovereignty. East Asia borders Siberia and the Russian Far East to the north, Southeast Asia to the south, South Asia to the southwest, and Central Asia to the west. To the east is the Pacific Ocean and to the southeast is Micronesia (a Pacific Ocean island group, classified as part of Oceania).</p>
